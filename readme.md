# Netflix Shows Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix shows data. The dataset contains information about various shows available on Netflix.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

* To explore and analyze the Netflix shows dataset.
* To preprocess the data and perform feature engineering to clean and prepare it for analysis.
* To utilize different visualization techniques such as heatmaps, bar plots, and pair plots to gain insights into the dataset.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is obtained fromhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/vivechanaagrawal/project-7-netflix-shows-dataset/input. It includes information about Netflix shows, such as title, type (TV show or movie), director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and listed_in (genre).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing** : The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and addressing inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering** : Additional features may be derived from the existing data to enhance the analysis. For example, extracting year from release date, categorizing genres, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** : Various exploratory techniques are applied to understand the characteristics of the dataset. This includes analyzing distributions, correlations, trends, and patterns within the data.
4. **Visualization** : Visualizations such as heatmaps, bar plots, pair plots, etc., are used to effectively communicate insights obtained from the data analysis process.

## Results

The EDA of Netflix shows provides valuable insights into various aspects of the dataset, including:

* Distribution of shows by type (TV show or movie).
* Top countries producing Netflix shows.
* Trends in release years.
* Relationship between duration and rating.
* Popular genres on Netflix.

## Conclusion

The EDA of Netflix shows dataset helps in understanding the content landscape on the platform. By analyzing the data and visualizations, we can identify trends, preferences, and patterns that can inform decision-making for content creators and platform administrators.
